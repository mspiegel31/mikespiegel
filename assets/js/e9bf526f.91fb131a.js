This wasn\'t some kind of triumphant, \\"oh I\'m so awesome at programming and I just want to tackle a puzzle\\" experience for me.  CoGL actually has a sort of special place in my heart as a big, scary Programming Interview Problem \u2122\ufe0f.\\n\\nThe last time I tried to attempted to implement CoGL was (you guessed it) an interview situation.  I (mistakenly) decided to show up with minimal prep, and unsurprisingly, I did not perform as well as I should have.  I never revisited the problem, and it became a sort of \\"programmers [yips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yips)\\" situation for me. \\n\\nI spent almost a year mentally berating myself.  Every time I would be proud of something I did at work, or excited about a job posting, the memory of bombing would resurface and ruin the positivity of the moment.  I don\'t know why, but for some reason this month I got tired of that cycle.  I sat down on a random Wednesday, had an extra-strong cup of coffee, and didn\'t stop until I had the problem sketched out.  It took about an hour and a half.\\n\\nNow, that\'s longer than the length of an interview. I\'m still pretty happy with the result.  More than the result, though, I\'m really happy to have reclaimed a little bit of self confidence. \\n\\nDon\'t let your inner demons keep you from getting back on that horse.  All the time you spend doubting yourself is wasted energy.  I guarantee the effort of trying again is much less painful than feeling sorry for yourself.\\n\\n\\nHere\'s a demo:\\n![conway-demo](./conway_small.gif)\\n\\n\\nyou can find the sourcecode [on github](https://github.com/mspiegel31/conways_game_of_life)."}]}}')}}]);
